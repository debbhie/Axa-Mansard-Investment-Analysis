# AXA MANSARD INVESTMENT OVERVIEW
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of my husband's investment with AXA Mansard from 2019 to 2024, based on the provided dataset. The primary objective of this analysis is to track deposits, liquidations, and profits generated from the money market investment. By examining these financial activities, this report aims to provide clearer insights into investment performance and offer strategic recommendations on optimizing returns by minimizing withdrawals or liquidations.

# DATA SOURCE
The dataset was obtained from AXA Mansard in PDF format. To make it usable for analysis, a PDF converter was used to transform the data into an Excel file. Since the extracted data was messy, it was cleaned and structured in Microsoft Excel before further processing.

# TOOLS
- Microsoft Excel: This was used for initial data loading and cleaning, transforming the raw dataset into a structured format suitable for analysis.
- Power BI: Employed for the main analysis and data visualization, enabling the extraction of key insights through DAX measures and visual tools.

# DATA PROCESSING
### Data Transformation:
Several steps were taken in Power Query (Microsoft Excel) to ensure the data was clean and well-structured:
- Data types were standardized.
- The first row was promoted to headers for consistency.

### Data Preparation in Power BI:
After loading the cleaned data into Power BI, the following transformations and enhancements were made:

* Date column breakdown: The day, month, and year were extracted to facilitate time-based analysis.

* Creation of a new table: A separate table was generated to highlight the largest withdrawals (sales).

* Addition of key measures to enhance the analysis:

  - Total Inflow (sum of all deposits/purchases)

  - Total Outflow (sum of all withdrawals/sales)

  - Net Cash Flow (difference between inflow and outflow)

  - Quarterly Returns (to track investment gains over time)

# SKILLS DEMONSTRATED
