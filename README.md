# AXA MANSARD INVESTMENT OVERVIEW
This report presents a comprehensive analysis of my husband's investment with AXA Mansard from 2019 to 2024, based on the provided dataset. The primary objective of this analysis is to track deposits, liquidations, and profits generated from the money market investment. By examining these financial activities, this report aims to provide clearer insights into investment performance and offer strategic recommendations on optimizing returns by minimizing withdrawals or liquidations.

# DATA SOURCE
The dataset was obtained from AXA Mansard in PDF format. To make it usable for analysis, a PDF converter was used to transform the data into an Excel file. Since the extracted data was messy, it was cleaned and structured in Microsoft Excel before further processing.

# TOOLS
- Microsoft Excel: This was used for initial data loading and cleaning, transforming the raw dataset into a structured format suitable for analysis.
- Power BI: Employed for the main analysis and data visualization, enabling the extraction of key insights through DAX measures and visual tools.

# DATA PROCESSING
### Data Transformation:
Several steps were taken in Power Query (Microsoft Excel) to ensure the data was clean and well-structured:
- Data types were standardized.
- The first row was promoted to headers for consistency.

### Data Preparation in Power BI:
After loading the cleaned data into Power BI, the following transformations and enhancements were made:

* Date column breakdown: The day, month, and year were extracted to facilitate time-based analysis.

* Creation of a new table: A separate table was generated to highlight the largest withdrawals (sales).

* Addition of key measures to enhance the analysis:

  - Total Inflow (sum of all deposits/purchases)

  - Total Outflow (sum of all withdrawals/sales)

  - Net Cash Flow (difference between inflow and outflow)

  - Quarterly Returns (to track investment gains over time)

# SKILLS DEMONSTRATED
This analysis involved multiple data processing and analytical techniques, including:
- Data Extraction & Transformation: Converting PDF data and cleaning it in Excel.
- Data Processing & Cleaning: Structuring messy data using Power Query.
- Data Analysis & Quick Measures: Creating meaningful insights with DAX measures in Power BI.
- Visualization & Reporting: Presenting findings in a clear and actionable format.
- Critical Thinking & Problem-Solving: Identifying key financial trends and investment opportunities.

# OBJECTIVES / PROBLEM STATEMENT
The primary objectives of this analysis are to:
- Track the inflow and outflow of money over the investment period.
- Calculate the Return on Investment (ROI) to evaluate profitability.
- Determine the Net Cash Flow to assess overall financial standing.
- Track total profits earned over the years and identify areas for optimization.

# DATA ANALYSIS AND VISUALIZATION
The analysis reveals several key financial insights related to the investment performance:
- Net Cash Flow: The account shows a negative cash flow of -8,409,749.65 over the course of the investment period. This indicates that outflows (withdrawals or liquidations) exceeded the inflows (deposits or purchases), leading to a net cash loss.

- Return on Investment (ROI): The ROI stands at -19.69%, highlighting that the investment did not yield positive returns and resulted in a loss. For every 100 units invested, 19.69 units were lost.

- Total Investment Profit: Despite the negative cash flow and ROI, the total profit generated from the investment over the years amounts to 720,487.31.

- Monthly Inflow and Outflow:
   * The highest monthly inflow was recorded in March, totaling 6,498,004.10.
   * The highest outflow occurred in the same month, with a total of 9,212,434.46. This suggests that March was a particularly active month for transactions, especially liquidations.
